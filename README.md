This repo contains code that **finds optimal laser input parameters** using **Reinforcement Learning with Keras**.  
This is a **DQN Agent-Environment system** that utilizes **keras-rl** for finding best parameters.  
(the code is an example how you should not organize working system, but nevertheless it works)
